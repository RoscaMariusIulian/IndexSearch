# Index and Search

## Part two

The challenge in this project was to browse and save recurively a folder structure files into dictionaries. After that, to remove all the stopwords and exceptions, to use stemming and lematization on words and to make direct index and reverse index dictionaries and saving them in MongoDB.

At the start of the execution the user has the option to look for words in the Folder structure he's about to check. If any are found, there will start a Boolean Search followed by a Vectorial Search in order to bring the best results back.

And this is how the script looks when it's working:
